# PJSK Bluestacks Control Scheme

*Works on both ***Bluestacks*** and ***MSI App Player.****   

These controls are designed with US laptop keyboards in mind *(specifically the MSI Stealth 15M - A11UEK).* Experience may vary on desktop keyboards.  
This repository comes with two **.cnf** *(config)* files.  

One is for standard rhythm gameplay and has keys **A** through **Enter** mapped to the horizontal width of the screen. *(A, S, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, ;, ', Enter)*  
And **Space** mapped for flick notes across **all lanes.** *(there is minor input delay)*  
This one is titled **"com.sega.ColorfulStage.en - RHYTHM.cfg".**  

The other is for first-person 3D events. You can use **W, A, S,** and **D** to walk, **P** to open the settings menu, **F** to screenshot, and the **Up** and **Down** arrow keys to zoom in/out, along with other misc controls.  
This one is titled **"com.sega.ColorfulStage.en - EVENT.cfg".**  

These controls work reasonably well enough for **Hard** and under rated charts, but don't expect to play anything past a like 18-20.
